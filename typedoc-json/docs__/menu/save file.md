## SAVE FILE

Save a Mobius `.mob` script file to your local drive. A dialog box will open up, allowing you to set
the file name and location where the file will be saved.

Mobius `.mob` script file includes:
* The dashboard settings
* The flowchart
* The parameters defined in the `Start` node
* The `Return`, if any, in the `End` node.
* The procedures and local functions for each node in the flowchart.
* The global function, if any.
* The viewer settings, for all viewers (CAD, Geo, VR, and Console)

Saving a Mobius script file saves the camera position and target, as defined in the settings of each
viewer. In order to update these camera settings to match the current camera view, you need to go to
the settings and click the `Get` button for camera position and target. For example, below are the
settings for the CAD viewer:
