/**
 * Calculates the xyz coord along an edge, wire, or polyline given a t parameter.
 *
 * The 't' parameter varies between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates the start and 1 indicates the end.
 * For example, given a polyline,
 * evaluating at t=0 gives that xyz at the start,
 * evaluating at t=0.5 gives the xyz halfway along the polyline,
 * evaluating at t=1 gives the xyz at the end of the polyline.
 *
 * Given a single edge, wire, or polyline, a single xyz coord will be returned.
 *
 * Given a list of edges, wires, or polylines, a list of xyz coords will be returned.
 *
 * Given any entity that has wires (faces, polygons and collections),
 * a list of wires will be extracted, and a list of coords will be returned.
 *
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Single or list of edges, wires, polylines, or faces, polygons, or collections.
 * @param t_param A value between 0 to 1.
 * @returns The coordinates [x, y, z], or a list of coordinates.
 * @example coord1 = calc.Eval (polyline1, 0.23)
