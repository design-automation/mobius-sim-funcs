## SAVE JS

Convert the Mobius script to a plain Javascript file, and save the `.js` file to your local drive. A
dialog box will open up, allowing you to set the file name and location where the file will be
saved.

The Javascript version of the script can be embedded in websites or executed by other third-party
programs. In order to be able to execute the Javascript, certain Mobius Javascript libraries will
need to be loaded. For more information, see [Embedding Mobius].
