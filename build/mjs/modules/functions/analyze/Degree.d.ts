/**
 * Calculates degree centrality for positions in a network. Values are normalized in the range 0 to 1.
 * \n
 * The network is defined by a set of connected edges, consisting of polylines and/or polygons.
 * For edges to be connected, vertices must be welded.
 * For example, if the network consists of multiple polylines, then the vertcies of those polylines must be welded.
 * \n
 * Degree centrality is based on the idea that the centrality of a position in a network is related to
 * the number of direct links that it has to other positions.
 * \n
 * If 'undirected' is selected,  degree centrality is calculated by summing up the weights
 * of all edges connected to a position.
 * If 'directed' is selected, then two types of centrality are calculated: incoming degree and
 * outgoing degree.
 * Incoming degree is calculated by summing up the weights of all incoming edges connected to a position.
 * Outgoing degree is calculated by summing up the weights of all outgoing edges connected to a position.
 * \n
 * Default weight is 1 for all edges. Weights can be specified using an attribute called 'weight' on edges.
 * \n
 * Returns a dictionary containing the results.
 * \n
 * If 'undirected' is selected, the dictionary will contain  the following:
 * 1. 'posis': a list of position IDs.
 * 2. 'degree': a list of numbers, the values for degree centrality.
 * \n
 * If 'directed' is selected, the dictionary will contain  the following:
 * 1. 'posis': a list of position IDs.
 * 2. 'indegree': a list of numbers, the values for incoming degree centrality.
 * 3. 'outdegree': a list of numbers, the values for outgoing degree centrality.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param source A list of positions, or entities from which positions can be extracted.
 * These positions should be part of the network.
 * @param entities The network, edges, or entities from which edges can be extracted.
 * @param alpha The alpha value for the centrality calculation, ranging on [0, 1]. With value 0,
 * disregards edge weights and solely uses number of edges in the centrality calculation. With value 1,
 * disregards number of edges and solely uses the edge weights in the centrality calculation.
 * @param method Enum, the method to use, directed or undirected.
 * @returns A dictionary containing the results.
