/**
 * Creates positions in a box pattern. Positions are only generated on the outer surface of the box.
 * No positions are generated in the interior of the box.
 * \n
 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the box for which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for a box aligned with the origin XY plane.
 * So if the origin plane is rotated, then the box will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `size` parameter specifies the size of the box.
 * - If only one number is given, then the width, length, and height are assumed to be equal.
 * - If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length]`,
 * and the height will be the same as the length.
 * - If a list of three numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length, height]`.
 * \n
 * The width dimension will be in the X-direction of the origin plane,
 * the length in the Y direction, and the height in the Z-direction.
 * \n
 * The `num_positions` parameter specifies the number of columns, rows, and layers of positions
 * in the box.
 * - If only one number is given, then the box is assumed to have equal number columns, rows,
 * and layers.
 * - If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows]`,
 * and the number of layers will be the same as the rows.
 * - If a list of three numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows, layers]`.
 * \n
 * The `columns` will be parallel to the Y-direction of the origin plane,
 * and the `rows` will be parallel to the X-direction of the origin plane.
 * The layers are stacked up in the Z-direction of the origin plane.
 * \n
 * For example, consider the following function call:
 * `posis = pattern.Box(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'flat')`
 * This will generate the following box:

 * \n
 * Below are the varying results when calling the function with the method set to
 * `flat`, `columns`, `rows` `layers` and `quads`:
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Box(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'flat')`
 * ```
 * posis = ["ps0", "ps1", "ps2", "ps3", "ps4", "ps5", "ps6", "ps7", "ps8", "ps9", "ps10", "ps11"]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'columns')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps1", "ps6", "ps7"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps3", "ps8", "ps9"],
 *     ["ps4", "ps5", "ps10", "ps11"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'rows')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps2", "ps4", "ps6", "ps8", "ps10"],
 *     ["ps1", "ps3", "ps5", "ps7", "ps9", "ps11"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'layers')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps1", "ps2", "ps3", "ps4", "ps5"],
 *     ["ps6", "ps7", "ps8", "ps9", "ps10", "ps11"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
* `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'quads')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps2", "ps3", "ps1"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps4", "ps5", "ps3"],
 *     ["ps0", "ps1", "ps7", "ps6"],
 *     ["ps1", "ps3", "ps9", "ps7"],
 *     ["ps3", "ps5", "ps11", "ps9"],
 *     ["ps5", "ps4", "ps10", "ps11"],
 *     ["ps4", "ps2", "ps8", "ps10"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps0", "ps6", "ps8"],
 *     ["ps6", "ps7", "ps9", "ps8"],
 *     ["ps8", "ps9", "ps11", "ps10"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * When the method is set to `columns` or `rows`, polylines can be generated as follows:
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Box(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'rows')
 * plines = make.Polyline(posis, 'open')
 * ```
 * When the method is set to quads, polygons on the box surface can be generated as follows:
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20,30], [2,3,2], 'quads')
 * pgons = make.Polygon(posis)
 * ```
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane|.
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane.
 * @param size The width, length, and height of the box.
 * If a single number is given, then the width, length, and height are assumed to be equal.
 * If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length]`,
 * and the height is assumed to be equal to the length.
 * If a list of three numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length, height]`.
 * @param num_positions Number of columns, rows, and layers of positions in the box.
 * If a single number is given, then the number of columns, rows, and layers are assumed to be equal.
 * If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows]`,
 * and the number of layers is assumed to be equal to the number of rows.
 * If a list of three numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows, layers]`.
 * @param method Enum, define the way the coords will be return as lists.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions, or a list of lists of positions
 * (depending on the 'method' setting).
 * @example `posis = pattern.Box(XY, [10,20,30], [3,4,5], 'quads')`
 * @example_info Returns positions in a box pattern. The size of the box is 10 wide (in X direction)
 * 20 long (Y direction), and 30 high (Z direction). The box has 3 columns, 4 rows, and 5 layers.
 * This results in a total of 12 (i.e. 3 x 4) positions in the top and bottom layers, and 10
 * positions in the middle two layers. The positions are returned as nested lists, where each
 * sub-list contains positions for one quadrilateral.
