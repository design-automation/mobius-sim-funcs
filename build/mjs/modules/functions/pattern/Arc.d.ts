/**
 * Creates positions in an arc or circle pattern.
 * \n
 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the polyhedron for which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for an arc aligned with the origin XY plane.
 * So if the origin plane is rotated, then the rotated will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `radius` parameter specifies the size of the arc.
 * \n
 * The `num_positions` parameter specifies the total number of positions to be generated on the arc.
 * \n
 * The `arc_angle` specifies the angle of the arc, in radians. Angles start at thet X-axis of the
 * origin plane and move in a counter-clockwise direction. Two angles are needed to define an arc,
 * a `start_angle` and `end_angle`. The angles may be positive or negative, and may be
 * greater than `2*PI` or smaller than `-2*PI`.
 * \n
 * Positions will always be generated in sequence, from the start angle towards the end angle.
 * - If the start angle is smaller than the end angle, then the positions will be generated in
 * counter-clockwise order.
 * - If the start angle is greater than the end angle, then the positions will be generated in
 * clockwise order.
 * \n
 * The angle may either be given as a single number, as a list of two numbers, or as `null`:
 * - If the angle is given as a single number, then the arc angles will be ser to be
 * `[0, end_angle]`. This means that the start of the arc will coincide with the X-axis
 * of the origin plane.
 * - If the angle is given as a list of two numbers, then they will be set to be
 * `[start_angle, end_angle]`.
 * - If the angle is set to `null`, then the arc angles will be set to be
 * `[0, 2*PI]` In addition, duplicate positions at start and end of the arc are
 * automatically removed.
 * \n
 * Note that setting the arc angle to null is not the same as setting it to `2*PI`
 * When setting the arc angle to `2*PI`, you will get a duplicate positions at start and end
 * of the arc.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane|, specifying the centre of the arc.
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane.
 * @param radius Radius of circle as a number.
 * @param num_positions Number of positions to be distributed equally along the arc.
 * @param arc_angle Angle of arc (in radians). If a list of two numbers is given, then the first
 * number specifies the arc start angle, and the second number the arc end angle, i.e.
 * `[arc_start_angle, arc_end_angle]`. If a single numer is specified, then the angles will be set
 * to `[0, arc_end_angle]`. If `null` is given, then the angles will be set to `[0, 2 * PI]`.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Arc([0,0,0], 10, 12, PI)`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 12 positions distributed equally along a semicircle of radius 10
 * starting at an angle of 0 and ending at an angle of 180 degrees, rotating in a counter-clockwise
 * direction.
