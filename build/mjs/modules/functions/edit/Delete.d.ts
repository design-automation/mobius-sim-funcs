/**
 * Deletes geometric entities: positions, points, polylines, polygons, and collections.
 * \n
 * - When deleting positions, any topology that requires those positions will also be deleted.
 * (For example, any vertices linked to the deleted position will also be deleted,
 * which may in turn result in some edges being deleted, and so forth.)
 * - When deleting objects (points, polylines, and polygons), topology is also deleted.
 * - When deleting collections, the objects and other collections in the collection are also deleted.
 * \n
 * Topological entities inside objects  (wires, edges, vertices) cannot be deleted.
 * If a topological entity needs to be deleted, then the current approach is create a new object
 * with the desired topology, and then to delete the original object.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Positions, points, polylines, polygons, collections.
 * @param method Enum, delete or keep unused positions.
 * @returns void
 * @example `edit.Delete(polygon1, 'delete_selected')`
 * @example_info Deletes `polygon1` from the model. The topology for
 * `polygon1` will be deleted. In addition, any positions being used by `polygon1` will be deleted
 * only if they are not being used by other objects.
 * @example `edit.Delete(polygon1, 'keep_selected')`
 * @example_info Deletes everything except `polygon1` from the model. The topology and positions for
 * `polygon1` will not be deleted.
