 * Get one or more collections from the model, given a name or list of names.
 * Collections with an attribute called 'name' and with a value that matches teh given vale will be returned.
 * \n
 * The value for name can include wildcards: '?' matches any single character and '*' matches any sequence of characters.
 * For example, 'coll?' will match 'coll1' and 'colla'. 'coll*' matches any name that starts with 'coll'.
 * \n
 * If a single collection is found, the collection will be returned as a single item (not a list).
 * This is a convenience so that there is no need to get the first item out of the returned list.
 * \n
 * If no collections are found, then an empty list is returned.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param names A name or list of names. May include wildcards, '?' and '*'.
 * @returns The collection, or a list of collections.
