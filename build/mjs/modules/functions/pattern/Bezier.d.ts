/**
 * Creates positions in an Bezier curve pattern, defined by a list of coordinates.
 * \n
 * The Bezier is created as either a qadratic or cubic Bezier. It is always an open curve.
 * \n
 * The positions are created along the curve at equal parameter values.
 * This means that the euclidean distance between the positions will not necessarily be equal.
 * \n
 * For the quadratic Bezier, three coordinates are required.
 * For the cubic Bezier, four coordinates are required.
 * \n
 * The `coords` parameter gives the list of |coordinates|
 * (three coords for quadratics, four coords for cubics).
 * The first and last coordinates in the list are the start and end positions of the curve.
 * The middle coordinates act as the control points for controlling the shape of the curve.
 * \n
 * The `num_positions` parameter specifies the total number of positions to be generated.
 * \n
 * For more information, see the wikipedia article:
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">B%C3%A9zier_curve</a>.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane| (three coords for quadratics, four coords for cubics).
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane. .
 * @param num_positions Number of positions to be distributed along the Bezier.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Bezier([[0,0,0], [10,0,50], [20,0,0]], 20)`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 20 positions distributed along a Bezier curve.
