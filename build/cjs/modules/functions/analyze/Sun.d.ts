/**
 * Calculate an approximation of the solar exposure factor, for a set sensors positioned at specfied locations.
 * The solar exposure factor for each sensor is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means that it has no exposure
 * and 1 means that it has maximum exposure.
 * \n
 * The calculation takes into account the geolocation and the north direction of the model.
 * Geolocation is specified by a model attributes as follows:
 *  - @geolocation={'longitude':123,'latitude':12}.
 * North direction is specified by a model attribute as follows, using a vector:
 *  - @north==[1,2]
 * If no north direction is specified, then [0,1] is the default (i.e. north is in the direction of the y-axis);
 * \n
 * Each sensor has a location and direction, specified using either rays or planes.
 * The direction of the sensor specifies what is infront and what is behind the sensor.
 * For each sensor, only exposure infront of the sensor is calculated.
 * \n
 * The exposure is calculated by shooting rays in reverse.
 * from the sensor origin to a set of points on the sky dome.
 * If the rays hits an obstruction, then the sky dome is obstructed..
 * If the ray hits no obstructions, then the sky dome is not obstructed.
 * \n
 * The exposure factor at each sensor point is calculated as follows:
 * 1. Shoot rays to all sky dome points.
 * 2. If the ray hits an obstruction, assign a wight of 0 to that ray.
 * 3. If a ray does not hit any obstructions, assign a weight between 0 and 1, depending on the incidence angle.
 * 4. Calculate the total solar expouse by adding up the weights for all rays.
 * 5. Divide by the maximum possible solar exposure for an unobstructed sensor.
 * \n
 * The solar exposure calculation takes into account the angle of incidence of the sun ray to the sensor direction.
 * Sun rays that are hitting the sensor straight on are assigned a weight of 1.
 * Sun rays that are hitting the sensor at an oblique angle are assigned a weight equal to the cosine of the angle.
 * \n
 * If 'direct_exposure' is selected, then the points on the sky dome will follow the path of the sun throughout the year.
 * If 'indirect_exposure' is selected, then the points on the sky dome will consist of points excluded by
 * the path of the sun throughout the year.
 * \n
 * The direct sky dome points cover a strip of sky where the sun travels.
 * The inderect sky dome points cover the segments of sky either side of the direct sun strip.
 * \n
 * The detail parameter spacifies the number of rays that get generated.
 * The higher the level of detail, the more accurate but also the slower the analysis will be.
 * The number of rays differs depending on the latitde.
 * \n
 * At latitude 0, the number of rays for 'direct' are as follows:
 * 0 = 44 rays,
 * 1 = 105 rays,
 * 2 = 510 rays,
 * 3 = 1287 rays.
 * \n
 * At latitude 0, the number of rays for 'indirect' are as follows:
 * 0 = 58 rays,
 * 1 = 204 rays,
 * 2 = 798 rays,
 * 3 = 3122 rays.
 * \n
 * The number of rays for 'sky' are as follows:
 * 0 = 89 rays,
 * 1 = 337 rays,
 * 2 = 1313 rays,
 * 3 = 5185 rays.
 * \n
 * Returns a dictionary containing solar exposure results.
 * \n
 * If one  of the 'direct' methods is selected, the dictionary will contain:
 * 1. 'direct': A list of numbers, the direct exposure factors.
 * \n
 * If one  of the 'indirect' methods is selected, the dictionary will contain:
 * 1. 'indirect': A list of numbers, the indirect exposure factors.
 * \n
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origins A list of coordinates, a list of Rays or a list of Planes, to be used as the origins for calculating exposure.
 * @param detail An integer between 1 and 3 inclusive, specifying the level of detail for the analysis.
 * @param entities The obstructions, faces, polygons, or collections of faces or polygons.
 * @param limits The max distance for raytracing.
 * @param method Enum; solar method.
