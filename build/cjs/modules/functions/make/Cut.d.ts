 * Cuts polygons and polylines using a plane.
 *
 * If the 'keep_above' method is selected, then only the part of the cut entities above the plane are kept.
 * If the 'keep_below' method is selected, then only the part of the cut entities below the plane are kept.
 * If the 'keep_both' method is selected, then both the parts of the cut entities are kept.
 *
 * Currently does not support cutting polygons with holes. TODO
 *
 * If 'keep_both' is selected, returns a list of two lists.
 * [[entities above the plane], [entities below the plane]].
 *
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Polylines or polygons, or entities from which polyline or polygons can be extracted.
 * @param plane The plane to cut with.
 * @param method Enum, select the method for cutting.
 * @returns Entities, a list of three lists of entities resulting from the cut.
