 * Rotates entities on plane by angle.

 * @param __model__
 * @param entities  An entity or list of entities to rotate.
 * @param ray A ray to rotate around. \n
 * Given a plane, a ray will be created from the plane z axis. \n
 * Given an `xyz` location, a ray will be generated with an origin at this location, and a direction `[0, 0, 1]`. \n
 * Given any entities, the centroid will be extracted, \n
 * and a ray will be generated with an origin at this centroid, and a direction `[0, 0, 1]`.
 * @param angle Angle (in radians).
 * @returns void
 * @example modify.Rotate(polyline1, plane1, PI)
 * @example_info Rotates polyline1 around the z-axis of plane1 by PI (i.e. 180 degrees).
