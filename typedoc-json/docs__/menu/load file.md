## LOAD FILE

Load an existing Mobius `.mob` script file from your local drive. A dialog box will open up,
allowing you to select the file to be loaded.

Loading a file will overwrite any existing script that is currently open. If required, first save
the current script.

When the file is loaded, it will be automatically executed if auto-execute is enabled in the
Settings. In some cases, it may be necessary to disable auto-execute, either because your script is
very slow to execute or because your script has an error that crashed the browser (such as an
infinite loop).

Loading a new file updates the viewer settings, including the camera position and target.
