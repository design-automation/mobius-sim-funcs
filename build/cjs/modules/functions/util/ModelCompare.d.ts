/**
 * Compares two models. Used for grading models.
 *
 * Checks that every entity in this model also exists in the input_data.
 *
 * Additional entitis in the input data will not affect the score.
 *
 * Attributes at the model level are ignored except for the `material` attributes.
 *
 * For grading, this model is assumed to be the answer model, and the input model is assumed to be
 * the model submitted by the student.
 *
 * The order or entities in this model may be modified in the comparison process.
 *
 * For specifying the location of the GI Model, you can either specify a URL, or the name of a file in LocalStorage.
 * In the latter case, you do not specify a path, you just specify the file name, e.g. 'my_model.gi'
 *
 * @param __model__
 * @param input_data The location of the GI Model to compare this model to.
 * @returns Text that summarises the comparison between the two models.
