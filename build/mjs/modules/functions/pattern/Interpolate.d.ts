/**
 * Creates positions in an spline pattern. Returns a list of new positions.
 * It is a type of interpolating spline (a curve that goes through its control points).
 * \n
 * The input is a list of XYZ coordinates. These act as the control points for creating the Spline curve.
 * The positions that get generated will be divided equally between the control points.
 * For example, if you define 4 control points for a closed spline, and set 'num_positions' to be 40,
 * then you will get 8 positions between each pair of control points,
 * irrespective of the distance between the control points.
 * \n
 * The spline curve can be created in three ways: 'centripetal', 'chordal', or 'catmullrom'.
 * \n
 * For more information, see the wikipedia article:
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_Catmull%E2%80%93Rom_spline">Catmullâ€“Rom spline</a>.

 * @param __model__
 * @param coords A list of |coordinates|.
 * @param type Enum, the type of interpolation algorithm.
 * @param tension Curve tension, between 0 and 1. This only has an effect when the 'type' is set
 * to 'catmullrom'.
 * @param close Enum, 'open' or 'close'.
 * @param num_positions Number of positions to be distributed distributed along the spline.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Spline([[0,0,0], [10,0,50], [20,0,0], [30,0,20], [40,0,10]],
 * 'chordal','close', 0.2, 50)`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 50 positions distributed along a spline curve pattern.
