## NEW FILE

Create a new Mobius `.mob` script file. The default script will contain a flowchart, consisting of
three nodes:
* A `Start` node.
* A middle node called `Node`. 
* An `End` node. 

The procedures in the nodes will all be empty. The script name in the start node will be `Untitled`.

Creating a new file does not affect any of the viewer settings, including the camera position and
target.
