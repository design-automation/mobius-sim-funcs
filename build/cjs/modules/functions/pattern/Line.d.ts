 * Creates a set of positions in a straight line pattern.

 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the straight line along which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated along an straight line aligned with the X axis of the origin
 * plane.
 * \n
 * Returns the list of new positions.

 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane|.
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane.
 * @param length The length of the line along which positions will be generated.
 * @returns Entities, a list of new positions.
