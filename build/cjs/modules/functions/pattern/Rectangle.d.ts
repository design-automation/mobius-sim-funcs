/**
 * Creates four positions in a rectangle pattern.
 * \n
 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the rectangle for which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for a rectangle on the origin XY plane. So if the origin plane is
 * rotated, then the rectangle will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `size` parameter specifies the size of the rectangle. If only one number is given,
 * then width and length are assumed to be equal. If a list of two numbers is given,
 * then they will be interpreted as `[width, length]`.The width dimension will be in the
 * X-direction of the origin plane, and the length will be in the Y direction of the origin plane.
 * \n
 * Returns a list of new positions.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane|.
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane.
 * @param size Size of rectangle. If number, assume square of that length;
 * if list of two numbers, x and y lengths respectively.
 * @returns Entities, a list of four positions.
 * @example posis = pattern.Rectangle([0,0,0], 10)
 * @example_info Creates a list of 4 coords, being the vertices of a 10 by 10 square.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Rectangle(XY, [10,20])`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 4 positions in a rectangle pattern. The rectangle has a width of
 * 10 (in the X direction) and a length of 20 (in the Y direction).
