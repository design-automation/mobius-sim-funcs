 * Moves entities. The directio and distance if movement is specified as a vector.
 * \n
 * If only one vector is given, then all entities are moved by the same vector.
 * If a list of vectors is given, the each entity will be moved by a different vector.
 * In this case, the number of vectors should be equal to the number of entities.
 * \n
 * If a position is shared between entites that are being moved by different vectors,
 * then the position will be moved by the average of the vectors.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities An entity or list of entities to move.
 * @param vector A vector or a list of vectors.
 * @returns void
 * @example modify.Move(pline1, [1,2,3])
 * @example_info Moves pline1 by [1,2,3].
 * @example modify.Move([pos1, pos2, pos3], [[0,0,1], [0,0,1], [0,1,0]] )
 * @example_info Moves pos1 by [0,0,1], pos2 by [0,0,1], and pos3 by [0,1,0].
 * @example modify.Move([pgon1, pgon2], [1,2,3] )
 * @example_info Moves both pgon1 and pgon2 by [1,2,3].
