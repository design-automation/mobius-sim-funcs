/**
 * Creates positions in a grid pattern.
 * \n
 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the grid for which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for a grid on the origin XY plane. So if the origin plane is
 * rotated, then the grid will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `size` parameter specifies the size of the grid.
 * - If only one number is given, then width and length are assumed to be equal.
 * - If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length]`.
 * \n
 * The width dimension will be in the X-direction of the origin plane, and the length will be in
 * the Y direction of the origin plane.
 * \n
 * The `num_positions` parameter specifies the number of columns and rows of positions in the grid.
 * - If only one number is given, then the grid is assumed to have equal number columns and rows.
 * - If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows]`.
 * \n
 * The `columns` will be parallel to the Y-direction of the origin plane,
 * and the `rows` will be parallel to the X-direction of the origin plane.
 * \n
 * For example, consider the following function call:
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10, 20], [3, 5], 'flat')`
 * This will generate the following grid:
 * \n
 * ![An example of pattern.Grid](assets/typedoc-json/docMDimgs/pattern_grid.png)
 * \n
 * The positions can either be returned as a flat list or as nested lists.
 * For the nested lists, three options are available:
 * - `columns`: Each nested list represents a column of positions.
 * - `rows`: Each nested list represents a row of positions.
 * - `quads`: Each nested list represents four positions, forming a quadrilateral. Neighbouring
 * quadrilaterals share positions.
 * \n
 * Below are the varying results when calling the function with the method set to
 * `flat`, `columns`, `rows` and `quads`:
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'flat')`
 * ```
 * posis = ["ps0", "ps1", "ps2", "ps3", "ps4", "ps5"]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'columns')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps2", "ps4"],
 *     ["ps1", "ps3", "ps5"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'rows')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps1"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps3"],
 *     ["ps4", "ps5"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * `posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'quads')`
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps0", "ps1", "ps3", "ps2"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps3", "ps5", "ps4"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * \n
 * When the method is set to `columns` or `rows`, polylines can be generated as follows:
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'rows')
 * plines = make.Polyline(posis, 'open')
 * ```
 * When the method is set to quads, polygons can be generated as follows:
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Grid(XY, [10,20], [2,3], 'quads')
 * pgons = make.Polygon(posis)
 * ```
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origin A |coordinate| or a |plane|.
 * If a coordinate is given, then the plane is assumed to be aligned with the global XY plane.
 * @param size The width and length of grid.
 * If a single number is given, then the width and length are assumed to be equal.
 * If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[width, length]`.
 * @param num_positions Number of columns and rows of positions in the grid.
 * If a single number is given, then the number of columns and rows are assumed to be equal.
 * If a list of two numbers is given, then they will be interpreted as `[columns, rows]`.
 * @param method Enum, define the way the coords will be return as lists.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions, or a list of lists of positions
 * (depending on the 'method' setting).
 * @example posis = pattern.Grid([0,0,0], 10, 3, 'flat')
 * @example_info Creates a list of 9 positions on a 3x3 square grid with a size of 10.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Grid([0,0,0], [10,20], [3,4], 'flat')`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 12 positions on a 3x4 grid. The grid as a width of 10
 * and a length of 20. The positions are returned as a flat list.
