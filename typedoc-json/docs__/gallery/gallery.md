## GALLERY  
  
The gallery pane shows a gallery of example Mobius scripts. 

Each example script has an image of a 3D model generated by the script. Clicking on the image will load the script. Once loaded, you can change parameter settings (if the model has parameters) and click the play button to execute the script. 
  
The example scripts are organized into categories. The drop-down menu in the top-right corner allows you to select a specific category. Alternatively, you can also just scroll up and down to see all the models generated by the example scripts.
