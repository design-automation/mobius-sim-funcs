/**
 * Calculates the shortest path from every position in source, to the closest position in target.
 * \n
 * This differs from the 'analyze.ShortestPath()' function. If you specify multiple target positions,
 * for each cource position,
 * the 'analyze.ShortestPath()' function will calculate multiple shortest paths,
 * i.e. the shortest path to all targets.
 * This function will caculate just one shortest path,
 * i.e. the shortest path to the closest target.
 * \n
 * Paths are calculated through a network of connected edges.
 * For edges to be connected, vertices must be welded.
 * For example, if the network consists of multiple polylines, then the vertcies of those polylines must be welded.
 * \n
 * If 'directed' is selected, then the edge direction is taken into account. Each edge will be one-way.
 * If 'undirected' is selected, the edge direction is ignored. Each edge will be two-way.
 * \n
 * Each edge can be assigned a weight.
 * The shortest path is the path where the sum of the weights of the edges along the path is the minimum.
 * \n
 * By default, all edges are assigned a weight of 1.
 * Default weights can be overridden by creating a numeric attribute on edges call 'weight'.
 * \n
 * Returns a dictionary containing the shortes paths.
 * \n
 * If 'distances' is selected, the dictionary will contain one list:
 * 1. 'distances': a list of distances.
 * \n
 * If 'counts' is selected, the dictionary will contain four lists:
 * 1. 'posis': a list of positions traversed by the paths,
 * 2. 'posis_count': a list of numbers that count how often each position was traversed.
 * 3. 'edges': a list of edges traversed by the paths,
 * 4. 'edges_count': a list of numbers that count how often each edge was traversed.
 * \n
 * If 'paths' is selected, the dictionary will contain two lists of lists:
 * 1. 'posi_paths': a list of lists of positions, one list for each path.
 * 2. 'edge_paths': a list of lists of edges, one list for each path.
 * \n
 * If 'all' is selected, the dictionary will contain all lists just described.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param source Path source, a list of positions, or entities from which positions can be extracted.
 * @param target Path source, a list of positions, or entities from which positions can be extracted.
 * @param entities The network, edges, or entities from which edges can be extracted.
 * @param method Enum, the method to use, directed or undirected.
 * @param result Enum, the data to return, positions, edges, or both.
 * @returns A dictionary containing the results.
