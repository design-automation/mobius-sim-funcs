## SAVE MODEL

Generates a new script file with an embedded static model inside it. (This is mainly used for
generating examples for modelling exercises, where the aim is to show the final result without
revealing the script.)

First, the script is executed with the saved parameter settings. The final model from the `End` node
of the flowchart is then extracted. A new script is then generated, with the static model inserted
into the script. In the description of the new model, the parameter setting used to generate the
model are described.
