/**
 * Shoot a set of rays into a set of obstructions, consisting of polygon faces.
 * One can imagine particles being shot from the ray origin in the ray direction, hitting the
 * obstructions.
 * \n
 * Each ray will either hit an obstruction, or will hit no obstructions.
 * The length of the ray vector is ignored, only the ray origin and direction is taken into account.
 * Each particle shot out from a ray will travel a certain distance.
 * The minimum and maximum distance that the particle will travel is defined by the 'dist' argument.
 * \n
 * If a ray particle hits an obstruction, then the 'distance' for that ray is the distance from the * ray origin to the point of intersection.
 * If the ray particle does not hit an obstruction, then the 'distance' for that ray is equal to
 * the max for the 'dist' argument.
 * \n
 * Returns a dictionary containing the following data.
 * \n
 * If 'stats' is selected, the dictionary will contain the following numbers:
 * 1. 'hit_count': the total number of rays that hit an obstruction.
 * 2. 'miss_count': the total number of rays that did not hit any obstruction.
 * 3. 'total_dist': the total of all the ray distances.
 * 4. 'min_dist': the minimum distance for all the rays.
 * 5. 'max_dist': the maximum distance for all the rays.
 * 6. 'avg_dist': the average dist for all the rays.
 * 7. 'dist_ratio': the ratio of 'total_dist' to the maximum distance if not rays hit any
 * obstructions.
 * \n
 * If 'distances' is selected, the dictionary will contain the following list:
 * 1. 'distances': A list of numbers, the distance travelled for each ray.
 * \n
 * If 'hit_pgons' is selected, the dictionary will contain the following list:
 * 1. 'hit_pgons': A list of polygon IDs, the polygons hit for each ray, or 'null' if no polygon
 * was hit.
 * \n
 * If 'intersections' is selected, the dictionary will contain the following list:
 * 1. 'intersections': A list of XYZ coords, the point of intersection where the ray hit a polygon,
 * or 'null' if no polygon was hit.
 * \n
 * If 'all' is selected, the dictionary will contain all of the above.
 * \n
 * If the input is a list of rays, the output will be a single dictionary.
 * If the list is empty (i.e. contains no rays), then 'null' is returned.
 * If the input is a list of lists of rays, then the output will be a list of dictionaries.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param rays A ray, a list of rays, or a list of lists of rays.
 * @param entities The obstructions, faces, polygons, or collections of faces or polygons.
 * @param dist The ray limits, one or two numbers. Either max, or [min, max].
 * @param method Enum; values to return.
