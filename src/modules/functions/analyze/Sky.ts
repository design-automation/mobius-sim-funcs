/**
 * Calculate an approximation of the sky exposure factor, for a set sensors positioned at specified locations.
 * The sky exposure factor for each sensor is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 means that it has no exposure
 * and 1 means that it has maximum exposure.
 * \n
 * Each sensor has a location and direction, specified using either rays or planes.
 * The direction of the sensor specifies what is infront and what is behind the sensor.
 * For each sensor, only exposure infront of the sensor is calculated.
 * \n
 * The exposure is calculated by shooting rays in reverse.
 * from the sensor origin to a set of points on the sky dome.
 * If the rays hits an obstruction, then the sky dome is obstructed..
 * If the ray hits no obstructions, then the sky dome is not obstructed.
 * \n
 * The exposure factor at each sensor point is calculated as follows:
 * 1. Shoot rays to all sky dome points.
 * 2. If the ray hits an obstruction, assign a weight of 0 to that ray.
 * 3. If a ray does not hit any obstructions, assign a weight between 0 and 1, depending on the incidence angle.
 * 4. Calculate the total solar expouse by adding up the weights for all rays.
 * 5. Divide by the maximum possible exposure for an unobstructed sensor with a direction pointing straight up.
 * \n
 * If 'weighted' is selected, then
 * the exposure calculation takes into account the angle of incidence of the ray to the sensor direction.
 * Rays parallel to the sensor direction are assigned a weight of 1.
 * Rays at an oblique angle are assigned a weight equal to the cosine of the angle
 * betweeen the sensor direction and the ray.
 * \n
 * If 'unweighted' is selected, then all rays are assigned a weight of 1, irresepctive of angle.
 * \n
 * The detail parameter spacifies the number of rays that get generated.
 * The higher the level of detail, the more accurate but also the slower the analysis will be.
 * \n
 * The number of rays are as follows:
 * 0 = 89 rays,
 * 1 = 337 rays,
 * 2 = 1313 rays,
 * 3 = 5185 rays.
 * \n
 * Returns a dictionary containing exposure results.
 * \n
 * 1. 'exposure': A list of numbers, the exposure factors.
 * \n
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param origins A list of coordinates, a list of Rays or a list of Planes, to be used as the origins for calculating exposure.
 * @param detail An integer between 1 and 3 inclusive, specifying the level of detail for the analysis.
 * @param entities The obstructions, faces, polygons, or collections of faces or polygons.
 * @param limits The max distance for raytracing.
 * @param method Enum; sky method.
