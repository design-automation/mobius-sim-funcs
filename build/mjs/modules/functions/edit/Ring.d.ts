/**
 * Opens or closes a polyline.
 * \n
 * A polyline can be open or closed. A polyline consists of a sequence of vertices and edges.
 * Edges connect pairs of vertices.
 * - An open polyline has no edge connecting the first and last vertices. Closing a polyline
 * adds this edge.
 * - A closed polyline has an edge connecting the first and last vertices. Opening a polyline
 * deletes this edge.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Polyline(s).
 * @param method Enum; the method to use, either `open` or `close`.
 * @returns void
 * @example `edit.Ring([polyline1,polyline2,...], method='close')`
 * @example_info If open, polylines are changed to closed; if already closed, nothing happens.
