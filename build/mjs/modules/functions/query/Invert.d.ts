/**
 * Returns a list of entities that are not part of the specified entities.
 * For example, you can get the position entities that are not part of a list of polygon entities.
 * \n
 * This function does the opposite of query.Get().
 * While query.Get() gets entities that are part of of the list of entities,
 * this function gets the entities that are not part of the list of entities.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param ent_type_enum Enum, specifies what type of entities will be returned.
 * @param entities List of entities to be excluded.
 * @returns Entities, a list of entities that match the type specified in 'ent_type_enum', and that are not in entities.
 * @example positions = query.Invert('positions', [polyline1, polyline2])
 * @example_info Returns a list of positions that are not part of polyline1 and polyline2.
