 * - Icosahedron (20 triangular faces)
 * - Dodecahedron (12 pentagon faces)

 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for a polyhedron aligned with the origin XY plane.
 * So if the origin plane is rotated, then the polyhedron will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `radius` parameter specifies the size of the polyhedron.
 * All positions that are generated are projected onto the surface of a sphere,
 * with the specified `radius`.
 * \n
 * The faces of the regular polyhedron can be further subdivided by specifying the level of
 * `detail`. (When subdivided, it will no longer be regular polyhedrons.)
 * \n
 * For tetrahedrons, octahedrons, and icosahedrons, the `detail` subdivides as follows:
 * - Detail = 0: No subdivision
 * - Detail = 1: Each triangle edge is subdivided into two edges.
 * - Detail = 2: Each triangle edge is subdivided into three edges.
 * - etc
 * \n
 * Cubes and dodecahedrons do not have triangular faces. So in these cases, the first level of
 * `detail` converts each non-triangular face into triangles by adding a position at the centre of
 * the face. The `detail` subdivides as follows:
 * - Detail= 0: No subdivision.
 * - Detail = 1: Convert non-triangular faces into triangles.
 * - Detail = 2: Each triangle edge is subdivided into two edges.
 * - Detail = 3: Each triangle edge is subdivided into three edges.
 * - etc
 * \n
 * The positions can either be returned as a flat list or as nested lists.
 * The nested lists represent the faces of the polyhedron.
 * However, note that only the positions are returned.
 * If you want to have polygon faces, you need to generate polygons from the positions.
 * \n
 * For example, calling the function with `detail = 0` and `method = 'flat_tetra'`,
 * will result in the following positions:
 * ```
 * posis = ["ps0", "ps1", "ps2", "ps3"]
 * ```
 * If you change the method to `method = 'face_tetra'`, then you will get the following nested lists.
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps2", "ps1", "ps0"],
 *     ["ps0", "ps3", "ps2"],
 *     ["ps1", "ps3", "ps0"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps3", "ps1"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * Notice that the number of positions is the same in both cases
 * (i.e. in both cases there are 4 positions: 'ps0', 'ps1', 'ps2', 'ps3').
 * When `face_tetra` is selected selected, the positions are organised into 4 lists,
 * representing the 4 faces of the tetrahedron.
 * \n
 * The nested lists can be passed to the `make.Polygon` function in order to generated polygonal faces.
 * Here is an example:
 * \n
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Polyhedron(XY, 10, 0, 'face_tetra')
 * pgons = make.Polygon(posis)

/**
 * Creates positions in an NURBS curve pattern, defined a list of coordinates.
 * \n
 * The positions are created along the curve according to the parametric equation of the curve.
 * This means that the euclidean distance between the positions will not necessarily be equal.
 * For open BSpline curves, the positions at the start and end tend to be closer together.
 * \n
 * The `coords` parameter gives the list of |coordinates| for generating the curve.
 * - If the curve is open, then the first and last coordinates in the list are the start and end
 * positions of the curve. The middle coordinates act as the control points for controlling the
 * shape of the curve.
 * - If the curve is closed, then all coordinates act as the control points for controlling the
 * shape of the curve.
 * \n
 * The degree (between 2 and 5) of the curve defines how smooth the curve is.
 * Quadratic: degree = 2
 * Cubic: degree = 3
 * Quartic: degree = 4.
 * \n
 * The number of coordinates should be at least one greater than the degree of the curve.
 * \n
 * The `num_positions` parameter specifies the total number of positions to be generated.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param coords A list of |coordinates| (must be at least three).
 * @param degree The degree of the curve, and integer between 2 and 5.
 * @param close Enum, 'close' or 'open'
 * @param num_positions Number of positions to be distributed along the Bezier.
 * @returns Entities, a list of positions.
 * @example `posis = pattern.Nurbs([[0,0,0], [10,0,50], [20,0,50], [30,0,0]], 3, 'open', 20)`
 * @example_info Creates a list of 20 positions distributed along a Nurbs curve.

/**
 * Creates positions in an spline pattern. Returns a list of new positions.
 * It is a type of interpolating spline (a curve that goes through its control points).
 * \n
 * The input is a list of XYZ coordinates. These act as the control points for creating the Spline curve.
 * The positions that get generated will be divided equally between the control points.
 * For example, if you define 4 control points for a closed spline, and set 'num_positions' to be 40,
 * then you will get 8 positions between each pair of control points,
 * irrespective of the distance between the control points.
 * \n
 * The spline curve can be created in three ways: 'centripetal', 'chordal', or 'catmullrom'.
