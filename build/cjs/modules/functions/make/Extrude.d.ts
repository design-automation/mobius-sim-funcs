/**
 * Extrudes geometry by distance or by vector.
 * - Extrusion of a position, vertex, or point produces polylines;
 * - Extrusion of an edge, wire, or polyline produces polygons;
 * - Extrusion of a face or polygon produces polygons, capped at the top.
 * \n
 * \n
 * The geometry that is generated depends on the method that is selected.
 * - The 'quads' methods will generate polygons.
 * - The 'stringers' and 'ribs' methods will generate polylines.
 * - The 'copies' method will generate copies of the input geometry type.
 *
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities A list of entities, can be any type of entitiy.
 * @param dist Number or vector. If number, assumed to be [0,0,value] (i.e. extrusion distance in z-direction).
 * @param divisions Number of divisions to divide extrusion by. Minimum is 1.
 * @param method Enum, when extruding edges, select quads, stringers, or ribs
 * @returns Entities, a list of new polygons or polylines resulting from the extrude.
 * @example extrusion1 = make.Extrude(point1, 10, 2, 'quads')
 * @example_info Creates a polyline of total length 10 (with two edges of length 5 each) in the z-direction.
 * In this case, the 'quads' setting is ignored.
 * @example extrusion2 = make.Extrude(polygon1, [0,5,0], 1, 'quads')
 * @example_info Extrudes polygon1 by 5 in the y-direction, creating a list of quad surfaces.
