/**
 * Creates a copy of one or more entities.
 * \n
 * Positions, objects, and collections can be copied. Topological entities (vertices, edges, and
 * wires) cannot be copied since they cannot exist without a parent entity.
 * \n
 * When entities are copied, their positions are also copied. The original entities and the copied
 * entities will not be welded (they will not share positions).
 * \n
 * The copy operation includes an option to also move entities, by a specified vector. If the vector
 * is null, then the entities will not be moved.
 * \n
 * The vector argument is overloaded. If you supply a list of vectors, the function will try to find
 * a 1 -to-1 match between the list of entities and the list of vectors. In the overloaded case, if
 * the two lists do not have the same length, then an error will be thrown.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Entity or lists of entities to be copied. Entities can be positions, points,
 * polylines, polygons and collections.
 * @param vector A vector to move the entities by after copying, can be `null`.
 * @returns Entities, the copied entity or a list of copied entities.
 * @example copies = make.Copy([position1, polyine1, polygon1], [0,0,10])
 * @example_info Creates a copy of position1, polyine1, and polygon1 and moves all three entities 10
 * units in the Z direction.
