/**
 * Calculates the normal vector of an entity or list of entities. The vector is normalised, and scaled
 * by the specified scale factor.
 *
 * Given a single entity, a single normal will be returned. Given a list of entities, a list of normals will be returned.
 *
 * For polygons, faces, and face wires the normal is calculated by taking the average of all the normals of the face triangles.
 *
 * For polylines and polyline wires, the normal is calculated by triangulating the positions, and then
 * taking the average of all the normals of the triangles.
 *
 * For edges, the normal is calculated by takingthe avery of the normals of the two vertices.
 *
 * For vertices, the normal is calculated by creating a triangle out of the two adjacent edges,
 * and then calculating the normal of the triangle.
 * (If there is only one edge, or if the two adjacent edges are colinear, the the normal of the wire is returned.)
 *
 * For positions, the normal is calculated by taking the average of the normals of all the vertices linked to the position.
 *
 * If the normal cannot be calculated, [0, 0, 0] will be returned.
 *
 * @param __model__
 * @param entities Single or list of entities. (Can be any type of entities.)
 * @param scale The scale factor for the normal vector. (This is equivalent to the length of the normal vector.)
 * @returns The normal vector [x, y, z] or a list of normal vectors.
 * @example normal1 = calc.Normal (polygon1, 1)
 * @example_info If the input is non-planar, the output vector will be an average of all normals vector of the polygon triangles.
