/**
 * Makes one or more holes in a polygon.
 * \n
 * The holes are specified by lists of positions.
 * The positions must be on the polygon, i.e. they must be co-planar with the polygon and
 * they must be within the boundary of the polygon. (Even positions touching the edge of the polygon
 * can result in no hole being generated.)
 * \n
 * Multiple holes can be created.
 * - If the positions is a single list, then a single hole will be generated.
 * - If the positions is a list of lists, then multiple holes will be generated.
 * \n
 * @param __model__
 * @param pgon A polygon to make holes in.
 * @param entities List of positions, or nested lists of positions, or entities from which positions
 * can be extracted.
 * @returns Entities, a list of wires resulting from the hole(s).
