## MENU

The Mobius Menu is available at the top of the browser window, as shown below:

![Mobius Menu](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu2.png)

## NEW FILE

Create a new Mobius `.mob` script file. The default script will contain a flowchart, consisting of
three nodes:
* A `Start` node.
* A middle node called `Node`. 
* An `End` node. 

The procedures in the nodes will all be empty. The script name in the start node will be `Untitled`.

Creating a new file does not affect any of the viewer settings, including the camera position and
target.

## LOAD FILE

Load an existing Mobius `.mob` script file from your local drive. A dialog box will open up,
allowing you to select the file to be loaded.

Loading a file will overwrite any existing script that is currently open. If required, first save
the current script.

When the file is loaded, it will be automatically executed if auto-execute is enabled in the
Settings. In some cases, it may be necessary to disable auto-execute, either because your script is
very slow to execute or because your script has an error that crashed the browser (such as an
infinite loop).

Loading a new file updates the viewer settings, including the camera position and target.

## SAVE FILE

Save a Mobius `.mob` script file to your local drive. A dialog box will open up, allowing you to set
the file name and location where the file will be saved.

Mobius `.mob` script file includes:
* The dashboard settings
* The flowchart
* The parameters defined in the `Start` node
* The `Return`, if any, in the `End` node.
* The procedures and local functions for each node in the flowchart.
* The global function, if any.
* The viewer settings, for all viewers (CAD, Geo, VR, and Console)

Saving a Mobius script file saves the camera position and target, as defined in the settings of each
viewer. In order to update these camera settings to match the current camera view, you need to go to
the settings and click the `Get` button for camera position and target. For example, below are the
settings for the CAD viewer:

![Camera settings in the CAD Viewer](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu_camera_settings.png)

**Setting Up Your Browser**

You are advised to configure your browser to allow you to name your files when you save. 
Depending on your browser, copy-and-paste the following into the URL address bar:
  * `chrome://settings/downloads/`
  * `edge://settings/downloads/`
  * `opera://settings/downloads/`
  * `brave://settings/downloads/`

For other browsers, please Google how to change these settings.

## SAVE TO LS

Save a Mobius `.mob` script file to the browser's Local Storage. A dialog box will pop up allowing
you to specify a filename.

The Ctrl-s keyboard shortcut will save the currently open Mobius script to Local Storage.

**Auto-saving Backups**

Each time you execute a script, it is also automatically saved to Local Storage. The name of the
file will be the name of the script, as defined in the `Start` node. If no name has been defined,
then the filename will be `Untitled.mob`. This works as a backup that allows you to recover your
script if the Mobius browser web pages closes unexpectedly or crashes and you have forgotten to save
your file. Note that it will automatically overwrite any existing files in Local Storage with the
same name.

Note that if you have multiple Mobius Modeller tabs open at the same time in the same browser, then
they will all be sharing the same Local Storage. This means that if you have multiple models that
have the same name or are unnamed, then they will all be saving to `Untitled.mob` each time you
execute.

## SAVE JS

Convert the Mobius script to a plain Javascript file, and save the `.js` file to your local drive. A
dialog box will open up, allowing you to set the file name and location where the file will be
saved.

The Javascript version of the script can be embedded in websites or executed by other third-party
programs. In order to be able to execute the Javascript, certain Mobius Javascript libraries will
need to be loaded. For more information, see [Embedding Mobius].

## SAVE MODEL

Generates a new script file with an embedded static model inside it. (This is mainly used for
generating examples for modelling exercises, where the aim is to show the final result without
revealing the script.)

First, the script is executed with the saved parameter settings. The final model from the `End` node
of the flowchart is then extracted. A new script is then generated, with the static model inserted
into the script. In the description of the new model, the parameter setting used to generate the
model are described.

## LOCAL STORAGE

Opens a dialog box, showing the contents of Mobius Local Storage.

Web storage allows web applications to store data locally within the user's browser. Web storage is
per origin, which means that all Mobius tabs in your browser can store and access the same data.
Other website or web applications cannot access any of the data in Mobius Local Storage.

The dialog box for Local Storage consists of two tabs:
* _Mob Files_: A list of all Mobius scripts (.mob) in Local Storage.
* _Others_: A list of all other files in Local Storage.

Here is the 'Mob Files' tab, showing two Mobius scripts.

![Mobius files in Local Storage](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu_local_storage_mob.png)

Here is the 'Others' tab, showing two data files.

![Data files in Local Storage](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu_local_storage_other.png)

For both 'Mob Files' tab and 'Others' tab, three buttons are provided for:
* Add File: Adding files from the local drive
* Download File: Copy a file from Local Storage to your local drive.
* Delete File: Delete a file from Local Storage.

**Scripts That Read and Write Files**

Mobius scripts can read and write files when they are executed. Two functions are provided:
* `io.Read`: Can read from Local Storage or from a URL. It cannot read from the local drive. 
* `io.Write`: Can write to both the local drive outside the browser, and to Local Storage within the
  browser. 

For `io.Write`, the two options are as follows:
* Read/write to local drive outside the browser: Each time the `io.Write` function is executed, a
  dialog box will pop up, requiring the user to manually confirm the action. The script execution
  will pause until either 'OK' or 'Cancel' is clicked. 
* Read/write to Local Storage within the browser: The `io.Write` can read and write files without
  any dialog boxes popping up and without any user intervention.

If a script is reading or writing multiple files, then it is annoying for the person who is
executing the script to keep having dialog boxes popping up. So in such cases, Local Storage is
usually used.

**Updating Global Functions**

Another use of Local Storage is updating global function. (For more information, see [Global
Functions].)

When working with global functions, you may often need to edit that function for some reason. In
such cases, you can have two Mobius script files open at the same time: the main script and the
global function script. After making edits to the global function script, you can save it to Local
Storage. Then, in the main script that calls the global function, you can open the global function
manager and click the refresh button to update the global function.

![Updating global functions](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu_update_glob_func.png)

## PUBLISH

Opens a dialog box for publishing your Mobius script.

When a script is published, it is uploaded to the cloud. This allows people on the internet to
interact with your script in various ways, such as changing the parameters and executing the script.
Note that when you publish your script, other people will also be able to download your script and
copy it.

When a mobius script is published, it is uploaded to the cloud. The first dialog box that opens up
allows you to select how you would like to upload your Mobius script. There are two options:
* _Upload to Cloud_: This will upload the currently open script to the Mobius cloud. The file will
  be saved in the cloud for one year, after which it will be automatically deleted. You will not be
  able to manually delete the file after it has been uploaded.
* _Use URL_: This will allow you to use a previously uploaded Mobius Script. (For example, you can
  upload your file to platforms such Github or Dropbox.) 

![Publish options](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/publish_start.png)

If you choose the 'Use URL' option, then a second dialog box pops up, allowing you to enter the URL.
Just paste your existing URL into the input box. The URL will then be validated, to make sure that
it points directly to a Mobius script file. 

![Validating a URL for publishing scripts](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/publish_url.png)

In the last dialog box, you generate a link for the uploaded file. For the link there are various
settings that you can define. For example, maybe you want a link that, when clicked, will open
Mobius Modeller and load your file, and also only show the dashboard and 3D viewer, hiding the
Flowchart and Editor panes. (This may be useful for people who want to see your model, but who do
not understand any of the coding behind it.)

There are two main modes: 'Explorer' and 'Developer'. 

**Explorer Mode**

If you you choose 'Explorer Mode', then the person looking at the published script will see a
simplified user interface. This user interface is designed for people who just want to explore your
script (changing parameters, executing the script, and viewing the results). The user interface does
not include the Flowchart pane or the Editor pane, so they will not see any of the code. The
'Explorer Mode' settings are shown below.

![Explorer Mode](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/publish_settings_explorer.png)

In 'Explorer Mode', you can set:
* _Show Viewers_: The viewers that are shown in the Mobius user interface. For example, if you only
  tick the CAD Viewer and the Console, then only those two viewers will be visible. The Geo and VR
  viewers will be hidden.
* _Active Viewer_: The viewer that is active. For example, if you want the person viewing your
  script to initially see the Console viewer open, then you can select the Console viewer from the
  list.

**Developer Mode**

If you choose 'Developer Mode', then the person looking at the published script will see the normal 
Mobius Modeller interface. The 'Developer Mode' settings are shown below.

![Developer Mode](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/publish_settings_developer.png)

In 'Developer Mode', you can set:
* _Active Pane_: The active scripting pane, either the Dashboard or the Editor. For example, if you
  want the person viewing your script to initially see the Editor pane open, then you can select
  'Editor' from the list.
* _Select Node_: The selected node in the flowchart. By default, the selected node will be the `End`
  node. The dropdown menu allows you to specify a different node to be selected. *_Active Viewer_:
  The viewer that is active. (Same as in Explorer mode.)

**Types of Links**

Finally, when generating your link, there are two options:
* _Create_Link_: Creates a URL link that you can share with other people, on social media or by
  email. People who follow the link will be able to interact with your published Mobius script.
* _Create Embed Code_: Creates a small snippet of code that can be embedded into another webpage,
  for example a blog. The embed code will result in a small embedded window (called an `iframe`) to
  be created. The size of the embedded window can be specified by editing the dimensions in the code
  snippet. The default is `width='100%' height='600px'`.

## SETTINGS

Opens a dialog box to set various Mobius settings.

* Execute on file load: If enabled, Mobius script files will be executed automatically after they
  are loaded.
* Auto-save after executing: If enabled, Mobius script files will be automatically saved to Local
  Storage after they are executed. This means that any changes you have made since the last
  execution will be saved and backed up. 
* Display Mobius Functions: Shows a list of all the categories of the functions in Mobius. For each
  category, if it is enabled, then the functions in that category will be visible in the left
  vertical menu in the Editor pane.`

**Setting Up Hardware Acceleration**

At the bottom of the setting dialog box, you will see the hardware that you have available for WebGL
rendering. For example, if you have an NVIDIA GEForce graphics card, it will show the details of
that card.

Mobius renders and displays 3D models using a library called
[WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/). This WebGL library can either use software rendering or
hardware rendering. 

Hardware rendering will give you a significant performance boost. So it is important that your 
browser is set to use hardware rendering. 

To check if you are using hradware acceleration, copy-and-paste the following into the URL address 
bar:
  * `chrome://gpu/`
  * `edge://gpu/`
  * `opera://gpu/`
  * `brave://gpu/`

You should see that `WebGL` and `WebGL2` are set to `Hardware accelerated`. For the Chrome browser, 
here an example of what you should see.

![Verifying that WebGL is using hardware in
Chrome](assets/typedoc-json/docUI/imgs/menu_chrome_gpu.png)

If WebGL is not set to `Hardware accelerated`, please check out this site: [setting WebGL to use
hardware
acceleration](https://support.biodigital.com/hc/en-us/articles/218322977-How-to-turn-on-WebGL-in-my-browser).
Or Google it for more information.

**Setting Up Your Graphics Card**

If you are using a laptop, then you may have two graphics cards. High-end laptops will often have 
an integrated graphics card and a high performance graphics card. 

The high performance graphics card (such as NVIDIA, Broadcom, AMD etc) will use more power, and 
will therefore drain your battery more quickly. Laptops will usually have default settings for 
browser to to use the integrated graphics, to save on battery. However, in order to get the best 
performance out of Mobius, you should change the default settings for your browser to use your 
high-performance graphics card.

How to do this will depends on your graphics card, so you may need to Google it. For NVIDIA, you 
can open the NVIDIA Control Panel on you laptop, and go to `Manage 3D settings > Program Settings` 
as shown in the image below. In this example, we set `Google Chrome` to use the `High-performance 
NVIDIA processor`.
