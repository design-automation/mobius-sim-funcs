/**
 * Creates positions in a polyhedron pattern.
 * \n
 * The five regular polyhedrons can be generated:
 * - Tetrahedron (4 triangular faces)
 * - Cube (4 square faces)
 * - Octahedron (8 triangular faces)
 * - Icosahedron (20 triangular faces)
 * - Dodecahedron (12 pentagon faces)
 * \n
 * The `origin` parameter specifies the centre of the polyhedron for which positions will be
 * generated. The origin can be specified as either a |coordinate| or a |plane|. If a coordinate
 * is given, then a plane will be automatically generated, aligned with the global XY plane.
 * \n
 * The positions will be generated for a polyhedron aligned with the origin XY plane.
 * So if the origin plane is rotated, then the polyhedron will also be rotated.
 * \n
 * The `radius` parameter specifies the size of the polyhedron.
 * All positions that are generated are projected onto the surface of a sphere,
 * with the specified `radius`.
 * \n
 * The faces of the regular polyhedron can be further subdivided by specifying the level of
 * `detail`. (When subdivided, it will no longer be regular polyhedrons.)
 * \n
 * For tetrahedrons, octahedrons, and icosahedrons, the `detail` subdivides as follows:
 * - Detail = 0: No subdivision
 * - Detail = 1: Each triangle edge is subdivided into two edges.
 * - Detail = 2: Each triangle edge is subdivided into three edges.
 * - etc
 * \n
 * Cubes and dodecahedrons do not have triangular faces. So in these cases, the first level of
 * `detail` converts each non-triangular face into triangles by adding a position at the centre of
 * the face. The `detail` subdivides as follows:
 * - Detail= 0: No subdivision.
 * - Detail = 1: Convert non-triangular faces into triangles.
 * - Detail = 2: Each triangle edge is subdivided into two edges.
 * - Detail = 3: Each triangle edge is subdivided into three edges.
 * - etc
 * \n
 * The positions can either be returned as a flat list or as nested lists.
 * The nested lists represent the faces of the polyhedron.
 * However, note that only the positions are returned.
 * If you want to have polygon faces, you need to generate polygons from the positions.
 * \n
 * For example, calling the function with `detail = 0` and `method = 'flat_tetra'`,
 * will result in the following positions:
 * ```
 * posis = ["ps0", "ps1", "ps2", "ps3"]
 * ```
 * If you change the method to `method = 'face_tetra'`, then you will get the following nested lists.
 * ```
 * posis = [
 *     ["ps2", "ps1", "ps0"],
 *     ["ps0", "ps3", "ps2"],
 *     ["ps1", "ps3", "ps0"],
 *     ["ps2", "ps3", "ps1"]
 * ]
 * ```
 * Notice that the number of positions is the same in both cases
 * (i.e. in both cases there are 4 positions: 'ps0', 'ps1', 'ps2', 'ps3').
 * When `face_tetra` is selected selected, the positions are organised into 4 lists,
 * representing the 4 faces of the tetrahedron.
 * \n
 * The nested lists can be passed to the `make.Polygon` function in order to generated polygonal faces.
 * Here is an example:
 * \n
 * ```
 * posis = pattern.Polyhedron(XY, 10, 0, 'face_tetra')
 * pgons = make.Polygon(posis)
 * ```

 * @example_info Creates positions in a regular tetrahedron pattern, with a radius of 20. The
